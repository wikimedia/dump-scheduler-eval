Did:

pip install luigi
Once again there don't seem to be packages around.

created luigi_dumptest.py

ran it by:

PYTHONPATH='.' luigi --module luigi_dumptest DumpTest --wiki tenwiki --date 20160913 --taskname xmlstubsdump --configfile /home/ariel/wmf/dumps/testing/xmldumps/confs/wikidump.conf.multi --scriptpath /home/ariel/wmf/dumps/testing/xmldumps --local-scheduler

This does not use the central scheduler.  Output from the task must be
captured and logged if you want it logged, this is not done for you
automatically.

Reruns of the task check if the given target output file exists; if it
does the task is declared complete.  Removing output for a new run must be
done outside of Luigi.

Failed runs did not get marked as failed (for example exceptions caused
by my failure to properly set up the run environment in the Popen call).
I tried a run with the nonexistent taskname "xmlstubs" and verified
that from the command line the worker.py script returns 1.  But luigi still
considered the run a success. It turns out that the run() method shouldn't
return anything, the only way for an error to be produced is by raising
an exception.

Retry count can be set by a little method in the class (as seen in the code).
The retry delay between jobs appears to be global however.

To run with the central scheduler one does the following:

luigid --background --pidfile /home/ariel/src/wmf/dumps/github/scheduler_eval/luigi/centralstuff/pid.txt --logdir /home/ariel/src/wmf/dumps/github/scheduler_eval/luigi/centralstuff  --state-path /home/ariel/src/wmf/dumps/github/scheduler_eval/luigi/centralstuff/state.txt

and indeed it is happily waiting for requests:

ariel     8272  0.0  0.1 254700 20756 ?        S    13:54   0:00 /usr/bin/python /usr/bin/luigid --background --pidfile /home/ariel/src/wmf/dumps/github/scheduler_eval/luigi/centralstuff/pid.txt --logdir /home/ariel/src/wmf/dumps/github/scheduler_eval/luigi/centralstuff --state-path /home/ariel/src/wmf/dumps/github/scheduler_eval/luigi/centralstuff/state.txt

The docs state:

"Task History is an experimental feature in which additional information about
asks that have been executed are recorded in a relational database for historical
nalysis."

I'll look at that in depth later.

Running the luigi task execution command without --local-scheduler causes various
output to appear on the console, and the job is run via the luigi daemon.  A small
amount of output appears in centralstuff/luigi-server.log showing GET requests
to the server. (Seriously, "INFO: 200 GET /api/add_task (127.0.0.1) 1.20ms"?  A GET
request to add something to the queue?)

I ran with the bad job name and checked the web server on default port 8082.  The
failed job shows up there.  I didn't see it scheduled for a retry.  After the
default 15 minute delay I still didn't see any activity so there's more to be
done somewhere to enable retries. Maybe the worker keepalive setting...
