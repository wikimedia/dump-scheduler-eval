Running jobs
------------

I copy over the jobs.properties file and the workflow.xml
file both to HDFS; strictly speaking I think the jobs.properties
file could live on the local filesystem of the edge node where
the user types the oozie command, if an absolute path were
given to the file at run time.

The startworker.sh script also gets copied over.

Because I decided to generate the job properties file
from a template, so that I could easily specify different
dump run dates, dump steps and so on, there's a little
python script that generates the file for me,
generate_workflow_files.py.

Because I'm even lazier than that, there is a bash script,
publish_start_job.sh, that runs the python script and then
pushes everything necessary out to hdfs; it then calls
oozie with the specified or default config file, date, wiki
and dump step to start the dump worker script.

Note that in order to copy the file it cannot already exist;
one must remove it first.  (Is there an overwrite mode?
I didn't find one but I did not look hard.)

To run oozie by itself, should you have all your files
on hdfs manually, you run (as whatever user you have set up,
for me that was oozie because lazy),
    oozie  oozie-url-here --config relative-path-to-properties-file -run
so for us that would be
    oozie job --oozie http://localhost:11000/oozie --config dumptest/job.properties -run
The oozie url is the default one, and if you go to that in your
browser you will be able to monitor currently running jobs as well
as check details of jobs that ran previously.
Why is it "-run" but "--oozie"?  No idea.

Besides the oozie web console referred to above, there is the
hadoop web console, available at http://localhost:8088/cluster/apps
I'm not clear on which things one wants to track with which console.
I don't know about an api so we could set up a more dump-user-friendly
sort of output.  This requires more digging.

I could attach some screenshots but git repo so meh.

If the above url works for you, there's one of the oozie web console.
Here's one of the hadoop console, if it's still working when you read this:
