This is a collection of various tidbits I came across when
reading documentation or books about Hadoop 2.x/Oozie.

Hadoop filesystem architecture:
* All file access is handled through a 'name node' which
not only checks file access permissions but does all
directory creation and modification, and all file creations
and deletions (and presumably renames).
* All file reads and writes are done by data nodes; the
user client is told which data node to access for which
file read/write by the name node.
* All file writes must be appends. The Hadoop filesystem
does not support writes at an arbitrary seek point.

File reads are fairly expensive because they must operate
on an entire hadoop filesystem "block" (by default,
128MB) and, more generally, on the entire file, if
compressed.  Files are compressed by default and broken into
pieces, so getting the last few lines of a file entails
uncompressing all of these pieces in order, with two
exceptions:
  - bz2 compression, since it is block oriented
  - lzo with "indexing" enabled so that a header at
    the beginning of the file contains an index of
    the byte offset of each block (lzo does not mark
    its blocks with a magic starting sequence of bytes
    as bz2 does)

File writes, typically done to three nodes for redundancy,
work like this: data node one (the edge node where the
job was launched) writes, on success it forwards the data
to data node two, which writes its copy, on success it
forwards the data to data node three.
If the user application sees success, this means at least
the first copy was written, and any failed replication
can be done async in the background.

File data only shows up in the filesystem after more than
a block (128MB by default) of data has been accumulated.
"Success" means the datanode has it in memory, not
necessarily written to disk.  One can hdflush() or
close the file to force the write.  This is of course
more expensive.  There is apparently an hsync() call,
check this.

There is a tool to balance the data nodes. I did
not look at it whatsoever.

We should think of the hadoop filesystem as optimized
for "write once, read many".

Namenode redundancy:
* One can have a primary and a secondary name node, with
regular updates from the primary to the secondary.  The
secondary must be set as primary manually in case of
failure of the primary name node.
* One can have an active and a standby (hot spare) name node.
The standby acts as a slave and automatically takes over
the job of the active name node in case of failure of that
server. This requires some sort of shared storage between
the active and standy nodes, which is handled by
Quorum-based storage, using the "Quorum Journal Manager",
which relies on a group of jornal nodes.

Data redundancy:
* By default, data in files is written to three different
nodes.
* By default, two of the nodes will be in the same rack
and one will not.  This is done to balance data rendundancy
and network efficiency.
* Cross-dc Hadoop is not a thing just yet.

I won't go into the details of map-reduce processing, there
are plenty of resources on that.  Note however that it is
possible to use a python script for the "map" and/or the
"reduce" part of the job if streaming (think of unix
pipes) is used to get the output of the first as input
to the second.

Security:
* Without Kerberos, any user can immpersonate any other
(still true?)  User names and group names are arbitrary
strings.
* Via the REST API, anyone can read/write to the Hadoop
filesystem (still true?)
* There is now a Hadoop filesystem acl but it does not
apply to the other components. Hrm.

There is an interface for users called HUE (Hadoop
User Experience).  WMF has one, users must be manually
added. I have not done any testing of it during this
eval.

Networking/BW:
* Oozie does not support IPV6.
* Ports of some services are randomly assigned by default,
but they can be set as fixed by the appropriate configuration
option in the corresponding xml file.

Hadoop filesystem usage:
* Besides the standard somewhat clunky hdfs dfs -<command> syntax,
  there is a hadoop filesystem client in python called
  snakebite, current release 2.11.  It handles operations
  at the level of the entire file; there are no provisions
  for appending to a file, or reading part of a file.  It
  does however do file counts, dus and other useful operations.
* The filesystem can be mounted via fuse_dfs.  It presents
  as a (mostly) POSIX filesystem.  Don't expect to do
  arbitrary reads and writes.  Cat/more, ls, du etc all
  work as expected. Note that fuse_dfs has no underlying support
  for permissions, all its accesses are done as the user
  running fuse_dfs.  BTW on stat1002 this is the root user.

Input/output data:
* In general, input data to jobs is expected to reside in
  the Hadoop filesystem.  Output is likewiese generated to
  the Hadoop filesystem.  Those action types that support it,
  require an output directory be specified.  If this directory
  already exists, the user's job will not be run, as Hadoop
  assumes that it has alreayd run and completed successfully.
  Reruns require that the directory and its contents be removed
  first.
* Stdout/err from a shell or other script does not seem to
  be captured by any log file.  Best is to run any script
  that may generate output, via a shell wrapper out of the
  shell action type, and redirect any output/err to a log
  file in that shell wrapper.

Java versions and paths
* Java 1.8.91 and on interacts badly with one part of the cdh5
  oozie (apache's version of it as well).  Downgrade to 1.7.x
* In /etc/hadoop/conf/hadoo-env.sh, JAVA_HOME needs to be set
  up to point to the java base. For us we used /usr/lib/jvm/jre-1.7.0

Oozie launcher notes
* When the user submits an oozie job, the workflow definition
  is submitted to the oozie server.  It submits a mapreduce
  job which is called a 'launcher' job.  All configuration
  settings you have for mapreduce jobs generally also cover
  oozie launcher jobs.
* To set specific settings for oozie launcher jobs apart from
  the rest of the mapreduce jobs, use configuration settings
  "oozie.launcher.blah.blah.blah"
* General mapreduce config settings start with "mapreduce.map."
  so oozie launcher config settings start with
  "oozie.launcher.mapreduce.map."

Oozie API/architecture
* REST api, all state information is in a db (we use mariadb)
* The oozie server consists of a hadoop client and a db client,
  at a very basic level.
* All commands except those executed directly by the REST api
  are queued. (Which ones are those?) There is a fixed thread
  pool for getting and running commands from the queue(s).
