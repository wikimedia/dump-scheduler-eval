The logs linked from the "history" link under the "Tracking UI" column for each job,
from the Oozie web interface http://localhost:8088/cluster/apps, link to the fqdn
instead of localhost.  I fixed every hostname and address I could find in the
configuration files for hadoop and oozie, so that they all say 'localhost', but
the problem remains.

I still don't know how to pass a path to the shell command via the "exec" tag
that is on the local file system so that it can run.  If I pass a path in the
hadoop filesystem and that script relies on other scripts which are on the
local filesystem and for which the full pathname is provided, those secondary
scripts all run properly.
